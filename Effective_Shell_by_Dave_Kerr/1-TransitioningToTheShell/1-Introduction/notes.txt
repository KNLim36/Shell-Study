The shell is an command-line interface to work with computers.
There are times when working in the shell is much more productive than working with GUI.
We can create shell scripts to automate frequently-used shell programs.

List of names for shell on:
- Microsoft Windows: Command Prompt, PowerShell
- Apple MacOS: Terminal
- Linux/Unix, Ubuntu: Bash

There are 3 ways to use shell on Windows:
- Use a tool which provides common Linux tools which have been written to work with Windows
- Use a "virtual machine" running Linux
- Use the Windows Subsystem for Linux

To replicate the feeling of using Linux on Windows, Cygwin can be used.

Oracle VirtualBox can be used to install Ubuntu which is one popular distribution of Linux.

Windows users can enable Windows Subsystem Linux to work with Linux-like shell.
First we turn on the feature in "Turn Windows Features on or off", after we restart, we can find Ubuntu in Windows App Store.

MacOS users might want to install Bash even though it is installed by default because the version might be out-of-date.
To install Bash, we can use Homebrew, a package manager for MacOS.

To check the Bash version installed on your machine, we can use "bash --version" without double-quotes.

"bash" is a command.
"--version" is a parameter.
"-lh" is a flag, another kind of parameter.

Parameters change how commands work.
