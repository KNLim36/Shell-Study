"$PWD" is also a variable that holds the current working directory.

"echo "My current working directory is: $PWD"" writes the line below:
My current working directory is: C:\Users\kean\Documents\GitHub\Shell-Study

In a shell script, the "#" notation is used to write comments.

Paths are addresses of files and directories.

There are 2 types of paths - absolute paths and relative paths.

Absolute path gives the exact location. It always starts with a forward-slash "/".
Relative path gives the relative position to the current working directory.

".." in a directory means the parent of the directory.
"." in a directory means the directory itself.

Both ".." and ".' exist for all directories in the system.

"cp . /backup" means copy everything in the current directory into a directory named "backup".

The home directory can be accessed with the tilde character (~).
"$HOME" points to the home directory too.

To quickly navigate from 1 directory to another and return, "pushd" and "popd" are used.
    "pushd ~/Downloads"
    "ls"
    "popd"

When "pushd" is invoked, the target directory is pushed onto a stack and the user moves into it.
When "popd" is invoked after a "pushd", the latest directory is popped off and the user returns to the origin directory.

Multiple "pushd"s can be used to quickly navigate to different directories, and consecutive "popd"s allow the user to return back to the original directory.

"cd -" also allows the user to go back to the previous directory, but it can be used only once.
