With the advent of the internet, programming has transformed from a high entry barrier endeavor to be universally approachable.
Because the people that are during programming are diverse, programming languages have evolved from their diverse needs.
Whereas previously there were only a small number of general-purpose languages and a large number of specialized languages.

"C", and later, "C++" were the go-to languages for systems programming (sometimes backed up by assembly language). 
This was the language which kernels and compilers were written in.

Alongside these giants were the workhorses for specific use cases. 
Erlang was (and is) a language which is highly popular in the telecommunications industry, where high availability and reliability were paramount. 
COBOL was the language for the financial industry, where mission critical systems ran on mainframes (and many still do).

Fast forward to recent times, the top ten languages (compiled by Stack Overflow 2020 Technology Survey) most wanted by employers are:
    Python
    JavaScript
    Go
    TypeScript
    Rust
    Kotlin
    Java
    C++
    SQL
    C#

Some languages like Swift, Dart, Ruby, Haskell, Scala closely follow this list too.

For the aged server side languages like Java, C, C++, C#, the development tools are powerful, all-encompassing and mature (some might say bloated).
Examples are: Eclipse IDE for Java, Visual Studio for Windows (C, C++, C#).

For the newer server side languages like JavaScript, Golang, Rust, and Python, the environment is just the shell.
For modern programming languages, users often have had to rely on the shell to compile, transpile, manage packages, bundle and so on.
Examples: managing Python virtual environments, running Node.js, installing packages for Golang etc.

Exactly because developers were exposed to the capabilities of the shell (whether of their own volition or not), they began to realize how powerful and efficient during work.
