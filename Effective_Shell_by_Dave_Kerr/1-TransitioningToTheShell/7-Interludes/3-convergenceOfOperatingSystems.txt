Even though we see proliferation of programming languages and tools in recent years, in many ways the operating platforms have been slowly becoming homogenous.

In the beginning each operating systems were highly diverse, proprietary, closed-source and specialized.

The modern execution environment is fairly uniform, and most of the time it is a Linux-like system.

More and more enterprise users moved away from proprietary Unix platforms to open-source Linux distributions for platforms (presumably to ensure support).

Even Windows start allowing Linux-like operations with its introduction to Windows Subsystems for Linux.

The rapid adoption of Docker as a common container technology introduced more engineers to operating environments that are like Linux.

To work with Docker and Kubernetes, shell skills are critical.
