The understanding of how input and output work together for command line programs is critical to use shell effectively.

Many of the programs follow a pattern:
    Input   --> |Program|   --> Output

Take "sort" for example:
    Dog                     Cat              
    Mouse   --> |Sort|  --> Dog
    Cat                     Mouse

Ctrl + D is a special control character which means 'end of transmission'

To manually type in things for "sort", we can use the "sort" command with no parameter.
Then we can type something in, press "Enter" to go to next line, then repeat until we are satisfied.
When we're done, we press Ctrl + D to tell the shell we've finished.
Immediately we'll get the sorted results.
